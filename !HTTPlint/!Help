HTTP Header Lint

__________________________________________________

Httplint performs various checks on HTTP/1.1
headers returned by a server.

It checks the syntax and content of almost all
HTTP/1.1 response headers, and also warns about
missing headers and suggests improvements.

To use, double click on !HTTPlint and enter an
address.

To use from the RISC OS command line, type

  httplint url [url ...]

at the * prompt.
